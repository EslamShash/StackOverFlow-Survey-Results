## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
If you want to run this code with the databases you will need to unzip the compressed databases and upload it to the jupyter netweork with the notebooks as the data bases names where changed for the ease of use.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow databases from 2011 to 2020 to understand:


   1. What is the most used programming languages across the years?
   2. How the gender is represented in the programming society acroos the years?
   3. Did job satisfaction increased or decreased from 2011 to 2020?
   4. How salaries ranges changes over the years?
   5. Can we predict the individual salary in 2020 and what are the factors affecting this prediction most?





## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. One of the note book have all the EDA analysis and the first machine learning model while the other notebook have all the datasets merged together and cleaned to only 13 columns to help predict salary over the period from 2011 to 2020. 

There is an additional `.py` file with helper functions in it to keep the notebooks neat and tidy.

## Results<a name="results"></a>
